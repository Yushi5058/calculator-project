# Calculator Project

## Creating a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for The Odin Project

### About the project

I created a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for The Odin Project. The calculator can perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is designed using HTML and CSS, and the functionality is implemented using JavaScript. The calculator is interactive and responsive, making it easy to use on any device. This project helped me to improve my web development skills and gave me a deeper understanding of how to use JavaScript to create interactive websites.
